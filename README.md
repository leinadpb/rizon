#### Hi, my name is Daniel

Before giving any instructions, thanks for the opportunity to show off my knowledge.

## Let's start
1. `docker-compose up --build`: This will setup the DB.
2. `cd client && yarn && yarn start`: This will start the frontend
3. `cd .. && cd server && yarn && yarn start:dev`: This will start the backend
4. `yarn seed`: This will add the sample data to the DB
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.

### Important notes:
You'll see two (2) functionalitites are missing and unit testing as well. Sorry, I didn't have time on the weekend to complete this and today is a business day and I have too much work to do for today in my current company since we are deploying a new sandbox environment for the APP and I'm leading the deploying.

Thanks for the opportunity, I can't spend more time on this.
